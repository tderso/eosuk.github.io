The Board of Trustees has been considering the future of Ethiopian Orphans Support UK Charity Fund (EOS-UKCF) at least for the past one year. The Charity has been supporting Elshadai Children's Village, Wukro (ECVW) for over 30 years, first as Friends of Ethiopian Children in Need (FECIN) since the early part of 1990s, and as EOS-UKCF since 2016. The Trustees are acutely aware that they have not been able to recruit new blood, which is important for the longterm viability of any charity, while they and their loyal supporters are not getting any younger. In fact, they have lost some of their supporters in the past two years.

On the other hand, the Trustees are pleased to say that since 2023, ECVW has come under the wings of Selam Charity Switzerland (SCS) which already runs three other centres in Ethiopia. SCS is already working with ECVW extensively and  hopefully things  get even easier for everybody once ECVW’s application to become a stand-alone charity, with its own bank account, becomes a reality.
 
For this reason the Trustees have decided that now is a good time to wind up EOS-UKCF. This will happen after the Trustees have their AGM in March 2025. They agreed on this course of action at their regular meeting on 22 October 2024 but have delayed closing date to give the Charity time to notify the management at ECVW, its donors and supporters, and other stakeholders, particularly Selam Charity Switzerland. EOS-UKCF is pleased to report that by the time it closes, it will have transferred over £115,000 to its beneficiaries at ECVW since it started in 2016. The trustees are very grateful to their loyal and generous donors without whom this would not have been possible.
