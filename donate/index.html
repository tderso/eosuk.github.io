			Ethiopian Orphans Support-UK Charity Fund (EOS-UK Charity Fund) depends entirely on donations from the public for its income that supports projects at Elshadai-Wukro Children's Village in Wukro. To give you some idea, it costs £20.00 (2016 prices) to maintain a child for a month – food, clothing, education, books, etc.... However you can give whatever you can afford. If you would like to help the fund you can contribute in a number of ways: 
			<ul>
				<li>
					you can make a one-off donation (<a href="{{ base }}/oneoffDonation">click here</a>);
				</li>
				<li>
					you can make a regular donation monthly (the preferred method for certainty of income) <strong class="text-orange">by banker’s order</strong>, or quarterly, half-yearly or annually. If you prefer regular donation, please <a href="{{ base }}/regularDonation">click here</a>
				</li>
			</ul>
